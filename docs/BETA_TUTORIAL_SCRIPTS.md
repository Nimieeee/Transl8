---

**[SECTION 1: Requirements - 0:15-0:45]**

[Screen: Voice cloning requirements]

**Narrator:**
"First, let's understand what you need. You'll need at least 6 seconds of clear audio of your voice. The better the quality, the better your clone will sound."

[Screen: Show good vs. bad examples]

"Good: Clear speech, minimal background noise, natural tone. Bad: Noisy environment, muffled audio, monotone reading."

---

**[SECTION 1: Understanding the Interface - 0:20-1:00]**

[Screen: Transcript editor overview]

**Narrator:**
"This is the transcript editor. On the left, you see the video player. On the right, the transcript with timestamps."

[Screen: Highlight different elements]

"Each segment shows the speaker, timestamp, and text. The confidence score indicates how certain the AI is about this transcription."

[Screen: Show confidence colors]

"Green means high confidence, yellow means medium, and red means low. Low confidence segments are where you should focus your review."

**Narrator:**
"Sometimes you need to merge or split segments. Here, two segments should be one."

[Screen: Select segments and merge]

"Select both segments and click 'Merge'. Now they're combined."

[Screen: Split segment]

"To split a segment, place your cursor where you want to split and click 'Split'. This is useful when one segment contains multiple sentences."

[Screen: Adjust timestamps]

"You can also fine-tune timestamps. Click the timestamp to edit it manually, or drag the segment boundaries in the timeline."

[Screen: Bulk operations]

**Narrator:**
"For larger edits, use the search and replace feature. This is great for fixing repeated errors or updating terminology throughout the transcript."

---

**[SECTION 4: Reviewing and Approving - 3:20-3:50]**

[Screen: Review checklist]

**Narrator:**
"Before approving, do a final review. Check all low-confidence segments, verify speaker labels, ensure technical terms are correct, and listen to a few segments to confirm accuracy."

[Screen: Approve button]

"When you're satisfied, click 'Approve Transcript'. This locks the transcript and moves to the translation stage."

[Screen: Approval confirmation]

"You can still edit after approval, but it will require re-processing the subsequent stages. So it's best to get it right now!"

---

**[OUTRO - 3:50-4:00]**

---

**[SECTION 1: When to Use Glossaries - 0:20-0:50]**

[Screen: Examples of glossary use cases]

**Narrator:**
"Use glossaries when you have brand names that shouldn't be translated, technical terms with specific translations, product names, acronyms, or industry jargon."

[Screen: Before/after comparison]

"For example, without a glossary, 'AI' might be translated as 'Inteligencia Artificial' in Spanish. With a glossary, you can keep it as 'AI' or specify 'IA'."

---

**[SECTION 2: Creating a Glossary - 0:50-2:00]**

[Screen: Project settings]

**Narrator:**
"Let's create a glossary. Go to your project settings and click 'Custom Glossary'."

[Screen: Glossary editor]

"Here you can add term pairs. Enter the source term and its translation."

[Screen: Add terms]

"I'll add some examples. Source: 'AI Platform', Translation: 'Plataforma de IA'. Source: 'StyleTTS', Translation: 'StyleTTS' - keeping it the same."

[Screen: Add more terms]

"You can add as many terms as you need. I'll add a few more: 'voice cloning', 'dubbing', and our company name."

[Screen: Save glossary]

"Click 'Save Glossary'. Now these terms will be translated consistently across your entire project."

"Glossary terms are highlighted in the translation editor so you can see where they're being used."

---

**[OUTRO - 2:40-3:00]**

[Screen: Tips]

**Narrator:**
"Pro tips: Create glossaries before processing, reuse glossaries across projects, and update them as your terminology evolves. This saves time and ensures consistency!"

## Multi-Speaker Tutorial (5 minutes)

### Video Title
"Dub Multi-Speaker Videos with Different Voices"

### Target Audience
Beta testers with interviews, podcasts, or multi-person content

### Learning Objectives
- Understand speaker diarization
- Assign different voices to speakers
- Review speaker segments
- Handle speaker identification errors

### Script

**[INTRO - 0:00-0:25]**

[Screen: Multi-speaker video example]

**Narrator:**
"Have a video with multiple speakers? Our platform can identify different speakers and assign unique voices to each one. Let me show you how to dub interviews, podcasts, and multi-person content."

---

**[SECTION 1: Speaker Diarization - 0:25-1:15]**

[Screen: Upload multi-speaker video]

**Narrator:**
"I'm uploading an interview with two people. During the transcription stage, our AI automatically identifies and labels different speakers."

[Screen: Processing with diarization]

"This is called speaker diarization. The AI analyzes voice characteristics to determine who's speaking when."

[Screen: Transcript with speaker labels]

"Here's the result. Each segment is labeled with a speaker ID: SPEAKER_00, SPEAKER_01, and so on."

[Screen: Color-coded speakers]

"Notice how each speaker has a different color. This makes it easy to see who's saying what."

[Screen: Speaker statistics]

"You can see how much each speaker talks. In this interview, Speaker 00 (the host) speaks 60% of the time, and Speaker 01 (the guest) speaks 40%."

---

**[SECTION 2: Assigning Voices - 1:15-2:30]**

[Screen: Voice assignment interface]

**Narrator:**
"Now let's assign different voices to each speaker. Click 'Configure Voices'."

[Screen: Speaker list]

"Here are all the identified speakers. For each one, you can choose a preset voice or a voice clone."

[Screen: Assign voice to Speaker 00]

"For the host, I'll choose 'David - Professional Male'. Let's preview how it sounds."

[Screen: Play sample]

"Perfect! Now for the guest..."

[Screen: Assign voice to Speaker 01]

"I'll choose 'Sarah - Conversational Female'. Let's preview this one too."

[Screen: Play sample]

"Great! These voices are distinct enough that listeners will easily tell them apart."

[Screen: Voice cloning option]

"If you want to use your own voice, you can assign a voice clone to any speaker. This is perfect if you're the host and want to keep your voice while dubbing the guest."

---

**[SECTION 3: Reviewing Speaker Segments - 2:30-3:30]**

[Screen: Transcript editor with speakers]

**Narrator:**
"Before processing, let's review the speaker identification. Sometimes the AI makes mistakes."

[Screen: Filter by speaker]

"You can filter to see only one speaker's segments. This makes it easy to review their parts."

[Screen: Incorrect speaker label]

"Here's an error - this segment is labeled as Speaker 00 but it's actually Speaker 01. Let me fix it."

[Screen: Change speaker label]

"Click the speaker dropdown and select the correct speaker. The color updates immediately."

[Screen: Merge speaker IDs]

"Sometimes the AI creates too many speakers. If Speaker 02 is actually Speaker 00, you can merge them."

[Screen: Merge speakers]

"Select 'Merge Speakers' and choose which ones to combine. All segments are updated automatically."

---

**[SECTION 4: Processing and Results - 3:30-4:30]**

[Screen: Start processing]

**Narrator:**
"Once you're happy with the speaker assignments, approve the transcript and translation. The TTS stage will use the assigned voices."

[Screen: TTS processing]

"During voice generation, each speaker's segments are processed with their assigned voice."

[Screen: Final video]

"And here's the result! Let's listen..."

[Screen: Play dubbed video]

"Notice how each speaker has a distinct voice. The host sounds professional and authoritative, while the guest sounds conversational and friendly."

[Screen: Compare to original]

"Compare this to the original..."

[Screen: Play original]

"The dubbed version maintains the natural back-and-forth of the conversation while speaking Spanish!"

---

**[OUTRO - 4:30-5:00]**

[Screen: Tips]

**Narrator:**
"Pro tips for multi-speaker videos: Review speaker labels carefully before processing, choose voices that are clearly distinct, consider using voice clones for main speakers, and test with a short clip first."

[Screen: End card]

"Multi-speaker dubbing opens up so many possibilities - interviews, podcasts, panel discussions, and more. Have fun experimenting!"
