### Template 9: Feature Highlight

**Subject:** New Feature: Custom Glossary for Better Translations

Hi [Name],

We just released a feature that many beta testers requested: Custom Glossary!

Define custom translations for specific terms (brand names, technical jargon, etc.) and they'll be used consistently in your translations.

Perfect for:
• Brand names
• Product names
• Technical terminology
• Industry-specific terms
• Names of people/places

How to use it:
1. Go to Project Settings
2. Click "Custom Glossary"
3. Add your terms and translations
4. Process your video

Example:
If you always want "AI" translated as "IA" in Spanish (not "Inteligencia Artificial"), add it to your glossary!

Try it out and let us know what you think!
